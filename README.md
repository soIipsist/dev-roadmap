## Roadmap

### Week 1

1) Download VSCode and watch the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9U-EBG8jVk).
2) Watch this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK9Oc6AEnR4) on Bash scripting.
3) Try project idea #1. Create a new repository for storing all the files.
4) Try using git as much as possible. When you update your script, push the changes.
5) Watch this [Python tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4), skip to the important parts. Don't waste your time.
6) Try project idea #2. You could use some of the ideas mentioned in this [book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com), or create something entirely different. As long as you learn the basics.
7) Create your personal website and host it somewhere. Use this [tutorial]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJSY8tbf_ys)) for learning HTML/CSS/Javascript and pick any of the learn how to host section (depending on where you want to host).
8) Dual boot Linux.
9) Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd7BXuUQ91w), and try to use your terminal as much as possible, even for mundane tasks.
10) [Learn SQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY).

### Week 2

1) Complete all data science courses.
2) Simultaneously, pick 3 relevant project ideas and work on them. Would be best to choose a subject that's related to what you're currently working on.

### Week 3

1) Finish 3 more projects.
2) Fix your CV, personal website and start applying.

### Week 4

1) Leetcode, study data structures and algorithms (if the company requires it).
2) Polish your projects and finish all course related material.
